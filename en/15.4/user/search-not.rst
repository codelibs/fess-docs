NOT Search
==========

NOT search can be used to search for documents that do not contain a specific word.

Usage
-----

For NOT search, place NOT before the word to exclude. NOT must be in uppercase letters with spaces before and after it.

For example, to search for documents that contain "term1" but do not contain "term2", enter the following:

::

    term1 NOT term2
