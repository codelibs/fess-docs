========================
Hidden Search Conditions
========================

You can use the ex_q parameter to maintain specific search conditions without displaying the condition text on the screen. The value of ex_q is retained even when the screen is refreshed through pagination.

Usage
-----

To execute a search with hidden conditions (for example, from a search form), add the ex_q value as a hidden form field when executing the search. This allows you to maintain the condition without displaying it on the screen, even when navigating through pages.
