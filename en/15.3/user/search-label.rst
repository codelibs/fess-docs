Label-Specified Search (Category Search)
=========================================

By adding label information to categorize search target documents, you can perform filtered searches by specifying labels at search time.

By registering label information in the administration screen, label-based searching becomes available on the search screen. Available label information can be selected from a dropdown menu when searching. If no labels are registered, the label dropdown box will not be displayed.

Usage
-----

You can select label information when searching. Label information can be selected in the search options dialog displayed by clicking the Options button.

By creating an index with labels configured, you can search documents by their assigned labels. Searching without specifying a label performs a normal full search. If you change label information, you need to update the index.
