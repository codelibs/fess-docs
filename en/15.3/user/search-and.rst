==========
AND Search
==========

Use AND search to find documents that contain all of the specified search terms. When multiple words are separated by spaces in the search input field without specifying AND, AND search is performed by default.

Usage
-----

To use AND search, specify AND between search terms. AND must be written in uppercase letters with spaces before and after it. AND can also be omitted.

For example, to search for documents containing both "term1" and "term2", enter the following in the search form:

::

    term1 AND term2

Multiple terms can also be connected with AND.
