Introduction
============

The last time\ `Part of the role-based
search <http://codezine.jp/article/detail/5605>`__\ The user permission
is required in how available |Fess| or introduced. An introduction of how
to do search and the results display in the client-side (browser side),
using the REST API is now |Fess| . In the REST API, |Fess| to use as a search
server Web system of the existing, and integrate changes only the HTML
is possible too.

In this article, explains |Fess| 8.1.0. About how to build a
|Fess| \ `Introduction
chapter <http://codezine.jp/article/detail/4526>`__\ Please see the.

Intended audience
=================

-  Those who want to search functionality into existing Web systems

-  Those who want to build a search system with AJAX

Required environment
====================

Regarding the content of this article in the following environment and
behavior verification.

-  IE 10

-  Firefox 21

REST API
========

According to normal HTML |Fess| search expressions in addition to search
results using XML and JSON (including JSONP) response is possible as the
REST API. Can also use the REST API should build a |Fess| server will
contact only the search results from the existing system to easily. I
think independent development language such as XML or JSON results
format, so easy-to-integrate |Fess| to non-Java System. You can handle it
easily even if it is XML or JSON support in JavaScript libraries, so as
Ajax.

See below about what return the REST API of |Fess| .

1. `XML
   response <http://fess.codelibs.org/ja/4.0/user/xml-response.html>`__

2. `JSON (JSONP)
   response <http://fess.codelibs.org/ja/4.0/user/json-response.html>`__

|Fess| uses Apache Solr as an internal search engine. SOLR also provides
XML and JSON API that |Fess| API is different. Benefits as well as SOLR
API, API |Fess| might |Fess| API in various |Fess| , such as control of search
log management and viewing rights of specific features are available.
Would use the Solr case developed from the structure of the document
crawling their own good, but easy to add and search features that |Fess| ,
can reduce the development cost of the many.

Building a site using the REST API
==================================

Describes how to build a |Fess| REST API using this site. Use the JSON
response to |Fess| server interaction. |Fess| server to utilize this time
uses a |Fess| server in the |Fess| project released as a demo. If the
install the |Fess| 4.0.0 or later if you want to use the |Fess| server of
your own. |Fess| 4.0.0 or later supports JSONP.

JSON and JSONP
--------------

Same-Origin policy should be aware when using the AJAX security model.
You must use the JSONP can use JSON if it displays in the browser HTML
output and |Fess| server exists in the same domain, but different. You can
use the JSONP in |Fess| REST API in the JSON response request parameters
with callback key value by passing.

Same-Origin policy. (B) the must |Fess| return search results (JSON)
becomes another domain if you use the JSONP.
|image0|

Advances the story in case that this time there was HTML and |Fess| 
servers are in different domains. So, please remove the callback from
the request parameter if the good example, but in the same domain by
using the JSONP.

To create a file
----------------

Implements the search process, this time using JavaScript in HTML. As a
JavaScript library using jQuery. You can also process, such as AJAX,
such as easy to implement in jQuery. Files you create will become.

-  To display the search form and search results to HTML file
   'index.html'

-  JS file to communicate with |Fess| server 'fess.js'

In the examples of this building has implemented the following features.

-  Search buttons send a search request.

-  In the search results list

-  Search results paging

Create a HTML file
------------------

Create the HTML search form and search results. Easy-to-understand this
time is to adjust the design with CSS, without to have simple tag
structure. In one of the following HTML file to use.

the contents of the index.html
::

    <html>
    <head>
    <meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=UTF-8">
    <title>Search site</title>
    </head>
    <body>
    <div id="header">
      <form id="searchForm">
        <input id="searchQuery" type="text" name="query" size="30">
        <input id="searchButton" type="submit" value="検索">
        <input id="searchStart" type="hidden" name="start" value="0">
        <input id="searchNum" type="hidden" name="num" value="20">
      </form>
    </div>
    <div id="subheader"></div>
    <div id="result"></div>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="http://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.9.0/jquery.min.js"></script>
    <script type="text/javascript" src="fess.js"></script>
    </body>
    </html>

We look below the body tag, and first id attribute in the header div tag
where search input box and the search button located by. Also, in the
hidden form holds display start position (start) and the number (num).
Search requests submitted in JavaScript update will start and the num
value. However, show is 1 page per, and no ability to change the number
displayed in this sample code, so the value of num is unchanged. Also,
you will not send this form page transitions occur if you have
JavaScript enabled for on the search form submit search requests are
communicated Ajax.

Displays information such as the number of hits in the subheader for the
following div tag where to search. displays search results and paging
links in the div tag of the result.

Load the 'fess.js' recently created this jQuery JS files and JavaScript.
I try to get via Google CDN may save the jQuery JS file in the same
directory as index.html, but this time.

Create a JS file
----------------

Create a JS file to display the search results, and then communicates
with the |Fess| server 'fess.js'. And create a 'fess.js' with the
following contents will put in the same directory as index.html.

contents of |Fess| .js
::

    $ (function() {/ / (1) |Fess| URL var baseUrl = "http://search.n9sm.co.jp/JSON?callback=?

runs after the DOM of the HTML file is built "fess.js" process. First,
specify |Fess| server URL by 1. In the specify |Fess| public demo server. To
get search results JSON data from external servers using JSONP. If you
use JSON, JSONP, without callback =? is not required.

2 save the jQuery object for the search button. Maintain the variable to
use the jQuery object search button several times and reuse.

3 defines search functions. Contents of this function is described in
the following sections.

20 registers events when the search form is submitted. Search button
press or when the decision was made in the search input field Enter key
press occurs when registered at 20. Search processing function doSearch
call when the event occurs. used for paging is the value passed when
calling the search processing function is the value of the Navi.

Register the event at 21 and 22 be added paging links are clicked. You
need to register event by the delegate because these links are added
dynamically. 20 Similarly, these events call the search functions.

Search processing function doSearch
-----------------------------------

Describes the search processing function doSearch 3.

Gets the starting position and number of 4. The value of these in the
search form in the header area saved as a hidden value. Display start
position is set the default value if other values because 0 or more, the
number of intended value from 1 to 100.

Determines the value of parameter navi passed doSearch event
registration, was 5 when the fix at the start of the show. Here,-1 is
previous page move, 1 following page move, otherwise, it will change to
move to the first page.

The decision to terminate the process and run a search if entered the
search input field value is 6, if empty, without anything.

7 in order to prevent double sub Mitt |Fess| Server contact while search
button to turn off in.

Assemble the URL to send Ajax requests in 8. 1 URL search, starting
position, and number of joins.

Send Ajax requests in 9. Use the JSONP so specify the jsonp on dataType.
Change the json to use JSON. Request comes back to normal, and runs the
success function. search results from |Fess| server returned success
argument object is passed.

First of all, in 10 has confirmed the contents of the response status. 0
is set if the search request was processed successfully. More
information on |Fess| JSON response\ `Fess 
sites <http://fess.codelibs.org/ja/4.0/user/json-response.html>`__\ Please
make sure.

Display a message if the search request is processed correctly, did not
hit the search results 11 conditional statements in with content of the
subheader area empty, did not hit results in the result area.

If you hit search results in the condition statement in the 12 search
result processing. Sets the execution time and number of messages in the
13 subheader area. 14 we will add a reault area search results. Search
results are stored as an array of data.response.result. results
[i]...-in by accessing search results can retrieve field values of the
document.

Page number in the 15 current page and add a link to the previous page
and next page result. With 16 saves current starting position and number
of hidden in the search form. The starting position and number of search
requests at next reuse.

Change the on-screen position of pages in 17. For the page itself is not
updated when clicked next page links to scrawlTop moves to the top of
the page.

18 the search process after search button to enable the. The request
succeeds or fails will perform complete to be called in.

Avoid sending form or link after a search operation functions was called
19 returns false. From this page transitions occur.

Run
---

access the 'index.html' in the browser. Displays the search form:

Search form

Enter a suitable search term and press the search button to display
search results. If there are 20 is the default display number, hit the
number of search results displays links to the following pages in the
bottom of the list.

Summary
=======

Using the REST API of the |Fess| and tried building jQuery-based client
search site. Build system not only browser-based applications that use
the REST API, use the |Fess| called from another application.

I want to show you how the next time the database scrawl functionality
to add full-text search capabilities to an existing database.
