===================================
Part 4: Natural Language Processing with Fess
===================================

**<<This page is generated by Machine Translation from Japanese. Pull Request is welcome!>>**

Last time we used Fess as a web scraping server to gather information on the site.
This time, I will introduce the natural language processing by Python using the information collected by Fess.
A Python environment is required, so prepare an environment that can use Python 3 in advance.

Natural Language Processing
===========================

Natural language processing is a set of technologies for processing languages spoken and written by computers using computers, and has various fields such as parsing and machine translation.
This time, we will focus on word segmentation including morphological analysis and document classification.

Fess uses Elasticsearch as a search engine, but Elasticsearch includes a word splitter by Analyzer provided by Apache Lucene.
Analyzer can be customized in various settings. By using this function, it is possible to realize Japanese morphological analysis and word segmentation for other languages.
If you can use Analyzer, you can use it for text analysis and machine learning.

Elasticsearch provides `Analyze API <https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/elasticsearch/reference/current/indices-analyze.html>`__ to access Analyzer via API.
Building an Elasticsearch environment just to use the Analyze API is hard.
This time, we will use the Python package `Esanpy <https://github.com/codelibs/esanpy>`__ which wraps the trouble and makes it easy to use.
Esanpy internally launches Elasticsearch with a minimal configuration and can be used without competing with existing Elasticsearch etc. that stores data.

Esanpy
======

Esanpy is an Elasticsearch-based text analysis package.
With Esanpy, you can use the Analyzer function of Elasticsearch as it is.
You can install with the following command.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install esanpy

The usage method is to import esanpy and pass the Analyzer name and text to esanpy.analyzer (), and the word array will be returned.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ python
   >>> import esanpy
   >>> esanpy.start_server()
   >>> esanpy.analyzer("今日の天気は晴れです。", analyzer="kuromoji")
   ['今日', '天気', '晴れ']

esanpy.start_server () launches Elasticsearch for text analysis in the background, so you need to run it once before using esanpy.analyzer ().
When the series of processes is completed and the word segmentation process is no longer needed, execute esanpy.stop_server () to stop the started Elasticsearch.

If you are running an Elasticsearch environment that stores search data, you can use the Elasticsearch for word segmentation with the Analyze API.
However, in my experience, if it is used as an API for text analysis, it is easier to use it separately from Elasticsearch for data storage, like Esanpy.
We used to operate Elasticsearch for both data storage and text analysis before, but we struggled to upgrade Elasticsearch.
In that regard, Esanpy is easy to deploy and operate.

Document classification
=======================

Create a text classification model using the IT Search + commentary / example articles obtained last time.
If you pass the body of the article (article_body) to this model, consider the contents and predict the category information (article_category).
The flow of creating a model is as follows.

-Get data stored in Fess
-Split text of acquired data into words
-Vectorize string data
-Create a text classification model
-Predict any text with text classification model

This paper does not discuss the evaluation of prediction results or tuning of parameters, so please refer to the scikit-learn documentation if necessary.

First, install the required Python packages.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install elasticsearch
   $ pip install numpy
   $ pip install scipy
   $ pip install scikit-learn


From the following code, put them in a .py file and execute them in order.
First, import the Python module used this time.

.. code-block:: python

   from elasticsearch.client import Elasticsearch
   import esanpy
   from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
   from sklearn.preprocessing import LabelEncoder
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier


First, use the Python module of elasticsearch to get the data stored in Fess.
Since this time data is stored in article_category and article_body, only that data is extracted to generate a Dicitonary array.
If you want to use Fess data for another purpose, I think that you can use it for each purpose by referring only to this code.

.. code-block:: python

   def load_docs(doc_fields,
                 es_host = 'localhost:9201',
                 fess_index = 'fess.search',
                 search_query = {"query":{"match_all":{}}}):
       es = Elasticsearch(es_host)
       response = None
       running = True
       docs = []
       # Fetch all items that match search_query by scroll search
       while(running):
           if response is None:
               response = es.search(index=fess_index,
                                          scroll='5m',
                                          size=100,
                                          body=search_query)
           else:
               response = es.scroll(scroll_id=scroll_id,
                                    scroll='5m',
                                    params={"request_timeout":60})
           if len(response['hits']['hits']) == 0:
               running = False
               break
           scroll_id = response['_scroll_id']
           for hit in response['hits']['hits']:
               if '_source' in hit:
                   docs.append({f:hit.get('_source').get(f) for f in doc_fields})
       return docs

   dataset = load_docs(['article_category', 'article_body'])
   # dataset = [{'article_category':'...', 'article_body':'...'},...]

Next, the text is split into words and vectorized to create a classification model.
Word segmentation of Japanese text is performed by morphological analysis with kuromoji using Esanpy.
In vectorization, scikit-learn's TfidfVectorizer converts the document group of artcile_body to TFIDF matrix X, and the predicted category information article_category is digitized by LabelEncoder and converted to integer array y.
X is used as an explanatory variable and y is used as an objective variable when creating a classification model.

.. code-block:: python

   # Start Esanpy
   esanpy.start_server()
   
   # Make the Analyzer used in TfidfVectorizer a function
   def ja_analyzer(t):
       return esanpy.analyzer(t, analyzer='kuromoji')
   
   vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(analyzer=ja_analyzer)
   corpus = [x.get('article_body') for x in dataset]
   X = vectorizer.fit_transform(corpus) # 説明変数の行列
   
   encoder = LabelEncoder()
   y = encoder.fit_transform([x.get('article_category') for x in dataset]) # array of objective variables


Create a classification model using X and y.
This time, we use scikit-learn's random forest as a method to create a classification model.
scikit-learn has various implementation methods and the interface is unified.
Fit to learn, predict to predict.
After learning with fit, you can predict the category of the text by passing any text to the random forest learner clf.

.. code-block:: python

   clf = RandomForestClassifier()
   clf.fit(X, y) # learning

   text = 'マウスコンピューターは6月20日、AMDのハイエンドCPU「AMD Ryzen 7 1700X」を搭載したデスクトップPC「LM-AG350XN1-SH5」を発売した。'
   preds = clf.predict(vectorizer.transform([text])) # prediction
   print('category: %s' % encoder.inverse_transform(preds))


By executing the above code, you can predict the category of the document passed by text as follows.

.. code-block:: python

   category: ['ソリューション']

(Because the document to be learned changes depending on the crawling time, the prediction result may be other than "solution")


Summary
=======

This time, we introduced document classification as natural language processing using data collected by Fess.
We could not introduce this time, but if you use `gensim <https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/>`__, you can also generate Word2Vec, Doc2Vec, etc. from the data collected by Fess.
There are many packages in Python, so I think that by combining them, you can use Fess for natural language processing and machine learning.

Next time, we will take a closer look at Analyzer, an important feature of the search system.
